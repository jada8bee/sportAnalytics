## Predictive Performance Analysis

Based on an althlete's statistics and conditions, a Isolation Forest Regression model will analyze a transformed database to predict the varying performance of said althlete in different seasons.

## Predictive Recovery Analysis

Based on the severity of the condition, a Linear Regression model will predict the recovery time of althletes and the probability of future injuries.

## Predictive Player Conditioning

Based on recovery time analysis, a deterministic ML model will guide althletes on conditioning techniques to expedite the recovery process.

## Data

For the data, we used simulated synthetic CSV data and was inspired by the data statistics from basketball governed by Intercol in Jamaica.
